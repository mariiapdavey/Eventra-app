        'Singer-songwriter & guitarist, Whitney Mongé learned to capture the power of authenticity while honing her skills as a street performer. ach part of her performance, from the passion of her powerful, smoky voice to the intensity of a whispered lyric, draws listeners into an embrace within each truthful moment of song. Whitney was raised with rhythm and blues in her blood, and while growing up in the Pacific Northwest, her music is heavily influenced by the alternative rock and indie folk scene of Seattle. Alec Shaw is a singer/songwriter and producer raised in the foothills of the cascades in Washington State, garnering attention as an artist whose sound has developed into a soulful combination of two large worlds of musical influence rooted in gospel and Appalachian folk. Vocally, he bridges a gap between Otis Redding and Jeff Buckley with a knack for engaging and ethereal arrangements.',
